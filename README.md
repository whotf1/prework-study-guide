# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description
-A HTML,CSS,JavaScript, or web suite application used to prepare this student for the coding bootcamp
-This program was made and used to introduce myself to the languages used for web developement, aswell as introduce myself to the content of the coding bootcamp.
-I wanted to start to learn the in's and out's of the coding world, and this prework was a doorway into that.
-This code should display elements setup with CSS, content written with HTML, and backend basics with JavaScript, additionaly documentation on the proccess provided with github, and industry standard application documentation!

## Installation

-N/A

## Usage

-This webpage includes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, aswell as industry standard documentation to simulate a working environment.
-In the Prework-Study-Guide folder you should find everything that actualy builds the website
-index.html is the html document in this project is almost solely used to render content onto the webpageI I.E the notes provided, the structure of how those notes look, titles or headers, pretty much anything that you can read is in the HTML
-the style.css document is rendering or helping to render, quite simply the style of the webpage, the boxes that souround the sections the shadows behind the boxes, the size and location of the picture(bowtie-cat.png). Even all these types of things you can assume are handled by style.CSS
-script.js would provide logic for the page, say if you wanted to search a list of people whome worked on the site, javascript would handle the functions that make that happen on the backend. For now in the JS we used one library(random), and array of topics, a function with a for loop that runs through and prints all the topics to the console. and a function that randomly selects a topic the the array of topics.
